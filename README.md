This program aims to solve the Collatz Conjecture
by testing every single number in order to find a counterexample.

## The Collatz Conjecture
The Collatz Conjecture is a currently unsolved mathematical problem.

It consists of a function which,
when applied to a positive integer a certain number of times,
is said to always return one.
The function's procedure is described below.

1. Take any positive integer;
1. If it's even, divide it by two;
1. If it's odd, multiply it by three and add one;
1. Repeat this procedure with the result of the operation.

If the Collatz Conjecture is true,
one should always get the number one as a result of applying these steps to
any positive integer.
